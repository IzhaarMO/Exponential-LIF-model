# Exponential LIF model - 2025
Study an exponential variant of the LIF (Leaky Integrate and Fire) model, in which the action potential (AP) threshold is not constant but depends on stimulation. This model provides a more realistic description of the behaviour of biological neurons.

📌 This project provides insight into how the introduction of exponential non-linearity alters integration dynamics and action potential triggering compared to the classical LIF model.
