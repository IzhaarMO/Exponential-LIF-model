# Exponential Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (eLIF) Model — 2025

**_This project is intended for educational purposes and does not aim to reproduce full biophysical neuron models._**

This repository contains the work developed for the **MMCN (Modélisation Mathématique et Computationnelle en Neurosciences)** course during the first year of the Master's program.

The project focuses on the **exponential variant of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model**, in which the spike initiation mechanism is modeled through an exponential non-linearity rather than a fixed voltage threshold.

Unlike the classical LIF model, the **exponential LIF (eLIF)** captures a more realistic description of action potential initiation by allowing the effective threshold to depend on the membrane potential and stimulation intensity.

📌 **Objectives**
- Understand how the exponential term modifies membrane potential dynamics
- Analyze the stability of fixed points under different stimulation regimes
- Compare spike initiation mechanisms between linear LIF and exponential LIF models
- Interpret model parameters from a biophysical perspective

📊 **Project content**
- Analytical study of the model equations
- Stability analysis of equilibrium points
- Numerical simulations of membrane potential dynamics
- Comparison between classical LIF and exponential LIF behaviors
